        <h1>Administrative Details:</h1>
        <p>
            Our client is Heidi Dalåmo. She is a dentist and currently she receives appointment bookings via Valentinlystsenteret's website 
            which is something she would like to change as she works private. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>Testing Document:</h1>
        <p>We wanted to focus on live testing/ “real observation” rather than using google forms. Therefor making the structure of the 
            deliverables of this document a bit different than what may was intended. we tried to get testers form different age and social 
            groups to test our website, since the intended audience for this website is everyone that needs dental care (over 21 years) 
        </p>
        <p>
            We wanted to first watch the test subjects and see how they would interact with the website, and later ask some questions to get more information. <br>
            These are the questions we asked:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What was your first impression of the website?</li>
            <li>How do you like the design? </li>
            <li>Was it easy to navigate around the website?</li>
            <li>Was there anything that was difficult to understand/ non-intuitive?</li>
            <li>Do you have other feedback?</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Tester Audience: </h1>
        <p> test person 1, 2, 3: <br>
            age: 21-24<br>
            job/ study program: student<br>
        </p>
        <p>At first, the user began to navigate around the website on their own, where we observed how the user moved through the pages and between them. We assessed 
            whether there were any aspects that were not as intuitive as intended or if the site was clear and well-organized. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The user's initial impression was of a very organized and informative homepage, where the necessary information was easily accessible. </li>
            <li>The user found it to have a simple design that could have been further developed to create a more professional website. </li>
            <li>When asked, the user mentioned that it was easy to navigate, and everything felt very intuitive. There was nothing specific that was difficult to understand. Through 
            observation, it was noted that upon the initial impression, the user did not realize that the icons in the footer were direct links to email, phone, etc.</li>
            <li>The technical aspects of the site were very good, providing a clear and understandable interface where one can easily find necessary information and book appointments. 
            There were quite a few buttons for booking, almost on the verge of being too many, but overall acceptable.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> Test person 4: <br>
            Age: 51<br>
            Job/ study program: preschool teatcher<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First impression is a clean and orginzed webpage. </li>
            <li>The design is cohesive and nice, where it's clear that there is a common theme running through all the pages.</li>
            <li>Yes, it was easy to navigate around the site.</li>
            <li>It should have been highlighted in the navbar which page you were on at any given time.</li>
            <li>There are some unclear categorizations on the 'treatments' and 'prices' pages, as they do not correspond. However, this is understandable if
                the price list is longer and contains more prices than the treatments the center has to offer.</li>
        </ul>
            
             
        <p> Test person 5: <br>
            Age: 53<br>
            Job/ study program: preschool teatcher<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Liked the website's intuitiveness and organization, but in the feedback, chose to focus on the mobile version of the site. The website is not fully 
                adapted for mobile; the content on several pages adjusts to the mobile version, but the navbar does not, making it very difficult to navigate around the site.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Test person 6: <br>
            Age: 31 <br>
            Job/ study program: (newly graduated developer) <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the first impresion is that it was a good looking homepage, but the user thought that there should be more padding between the sides of the screen and content on the homepage</li>
            <li>the user found it easy to navigate around the page</li>
            <li>the user thought that it would be more intuitiver to have a different mouse pointer (white pointy hand) when you hoover over the elements that can be clicked to get more information on the treatments page. And found a bug, that is if you try to copy the text on the treatments page, the drop-down menu closes. </li>
            <li>the user thought the interaction with the header felt a bit weird, and didn't quite like that the other header elements mooved when hoovering over a header element</li>
            <li>the user also suggesated that on the booking page, there would be better if the input fields with name, address, phone ect. would come with suggestions for pre-filled input like there is on many other web pages. </li>
            <li>the user also thought it would be nice to have a marker in the header for which of the pages you are currently on</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Test person 7: <br>
            Age: 52 <br>
            Job/ study program: self-employed <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the user thought the homepage looked simple, clean and professional, and described it at "something you would expect from a regular dentist webpage"</li>
            <li>the user thought there could be some more color to the page, but also argumentet that this maybe would conflict with the proffesional look of the page. She also mentioned that she thought the text size of the elements on the treatmens page was a bit small, and that she liked the look of the prices page better </li>
            <li>the user found it easy and intuitive to navigate arount the page. she also liked that there was several alternative ways to get to the different pages (especially booking)</li>
            <li>the user thought it was a bit dificult to understand that you could click on the treatments to get a drop down with more information</li>
            <li>the user would want to have suggestions for the input fields on the booking page</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Test person 8: <br>
            Age: 20 <br>
            job/study program: nursing school <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The user said that she liked the webpage, and that her first impression was that the webpage was clean and professional. the user also said that she thought the colors of the webpage fitted with the theam. </li>
            <li>The user thought that it was easy to navigate aroud the page.</li>
            <li>The user said that we should focus on developing the mobile version of the page, beacuse most people use their phone when they want to book a dentist appointment.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Test person 8: <br>
            Age: 20 <br>
            job/study program: marine engineer student <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The users first impression of the page was that it looked nice and professional.</li>
            <li>The user found it easy to navigate aroud the webpage.</li>
            <li>The user said that she didn't quite understand at first that there was a drop down menu at the treatment page. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Test person 9: <br>
            Age: 22 <br>
            job/study program: informatics student <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The user liked the site overall, both functionality and design</li>
            <li>They wished the prices were either with the treatments, or under the same categories</li>
            <li>They mentioned that the "postnummer" and "telefon"-input fields in the booking form accepted invalid inputs also</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h1>Testing Platforms: </h1> 
        <p>
            Test person 1, 2, 3: google chrome <br>
            Test person 1: safari -> The navigation bar menu is shifted to the right in Safari, which is not the case in Google Chrome. <br>
            Test person 6 and 7: windows 11, google chrome 
        </p>


        <h1>Feedback Summary: </h1> 
       <p>Our testers were mostly very impressed with our website and found the functionality and design good. <br> However, a few things were mentioned more often than others:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>There should be a mobile version available</li>
        <li>The dropdowns could be difficult to understand</li>
        <li>There could be suggestions in the booking input fields</li>
       </ul>
        
       
        <h1>Your Response: </h1> 
        <p>
            We tried to take all response, both positive and negative into consideration. Sometimes it was easy to respond with an 
            explanation to why we had choosen to do something in a certain way, instead of only listening to the feedback. But after 
            becoming aware of this, it was easier to just accept the feedback. 
            <br>
            <br>
            To address feedback we would start to look at the most critical feedback comments i.e. problems that prevents 
            users form getting all the information they need form the webpage, problems with navigating to the pages they need ect. 
            Secondly, we would look at the feedback regarding non- critical problems, like efficiency eg. auto-fill in the booking 
            page ect.
            <br>
            <br>
            The feedback we recieved was mostly things we were already aware of, such as a missing mobile version, but we had decided to not focus on those things. 
            We did not specifically change any of the functionality after testing (except fixing some bugs), but if we were to keep working on our page, this feedback would be a great list to follow to improve the site.

        <h1>Self-reflection: </h1>
        <p>
            We have learned a lot from this project. We have learned to implement what we have learned during lectures and 
            in the assignment into a much bigger and more complex project. We have learned new coding skills, to work our way 
            around problematic code problems and to think about new, better, and more efficient solutions. We have also learned 
            more about how DOM and how all different elements are connected. Also, we have learned de basics about git lab, 
            and how to collaborate on a bigger project with many different tasks. In addition, we have also expanded our knowledge 
            about teamwork and project management when working with this project. 
            <br> <br>
            The biggest problem we had during the project was with git and gitlab. We solved this by taking the time to learn about branches and merging, 
            which was super helpful. We feel that overall, what we have leart has been super helpful both for this course, but also something we will user later in our studies and life.
