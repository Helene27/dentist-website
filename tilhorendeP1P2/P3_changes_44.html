        </ul>


        <h2>The changes we have made</h2>

        <p>We had initially planned to have 7 pages. We have changed some of the styling, names, structure and purpose of them, leading to a total of 8 pages. All the changes are summarrized below.</p>
        
        <h4>Changes to homepage.html:</h4>
        <p>The homepage is pretty close to what we aditionally pictured, but there have been some changes to the content. We wanted to make the page more dynamic, so we added a javascript-function to the main picture frame that switches between four images on a three-second interval. To make it more understandable what the page is for, we added the text "Tannlege Heidi Dalåmo" below the picture. <br> The content below that is mostly the same, except we moved the boxes around a bit and switched the picture of Heidi for an interactive map, and decided on some other themes for the boxes that was more important to have on the front page (such as the student discount instead of why choose us).</p>

        <h4>Changes to about.html:</h4>
        <p>Contrary to our P2 mockup, we decided to place the pictures of Heidi and her assistants at the bottom of the text for a more structured look.</p>

        <h4>Changes to treatmens.html:</h4>
        <p>The treatments page was changed such that each subheader contained the treatments allocated to that subheader, without the description of the treatments viewable unless you click on it; where a description of the treatment will appear with the use of a toggle function achieved by javascript. This is to make the website both more visually appealing and less cluttered, but also to make it more interactive. <br> The booking button was moved to be under the treatments for aesthetic purposes as well as making the page look less cluttered. We also removed the price estimate at the end of each treatment as the price.html is comprehensively sufficient. Other than that, the design of the page was kept similar to the outline in P2.</p>

        <h4>Changes to prices.html:</h4>
        <p>The structure of the page is fairly the same, but we added a function that hides the prices in each category unless the category title is clicked on. The bottom button also redirects to the booking page instead of treatments.</p>

        <h4>Changes to booking.html:</h4>
        <p>The biggest change we have made here is to have the entire form in one column as this is easier to read and less confusing for the user.</p>

        <h4>Changes to contactus.html:</h4>
        <p>We added a bigger interactive map here, and moved around the content a little.</p>

        <h4>Other html changes: </h4>
        <p>In P2, we planned to have a booking-button in the bottom right of every page, but we decided this would be a bit messy, and have instead placed booking-buttons and links around the site such as in a box on the front page. As well as the "back to homepage"-button, we switched this out for a button in the header. <br> We made two additional pages, a confirmation page that shows up when you submit the booking, and a terms and conditions-page that you can read by clicking a link on the booking page.</p>
       
        <h4>JavaScript changes and how we have met the minimum requirements:</h4>
        <p>As we didn't know a lot of JavaScript when we wrote P2, we have made big changes to our JavaScript files and functions. The only function we kept was using JavaScript for the header and footer, but we divided these into two separate files (header.js and footer.js). <br> Our dropdown.js-file includes a function for hiding the content in the treatments and prices pages. The button.js-file is what makes the weekday-selector on the booking page possible. <br> The formvalidation.js-file includes a short function that opens the confirmation page after submitting the booking. Lastly, the picslider.js-file is used on the front page to make the picture change every three seconds.</p>

        <h2>Updated organizational scheme</h2>
